Syntax is exactly like grammer, and it identifies general rules for writing code.
It defines the order and the structure.
Semantics on the other hand is in the realm of meaning, it defines the basic relation
and makes sure that each line is meaningful. Basic terminology says if a framework
makes use of a lot of syntax it accomplishes the same task wiht much more code.
Well on the other hand a clean syntax is readable, reliable and concis.

Using the console becomes very handy. Here are some shortcuts.

Html, Css and Js can be described as Content, Style and Interactivity.

Every browser has a built-in js engine in it.

One of the things you can't do is to connect one file to another and provide
the code at the same time. Cause when you write the source the body, code between the
tags is directly ignored.

And the reason we chose to put the <script></script> tags at and of the html document
just before the closing body tag is to allow the browser to load html content before
executing any js code.

Spotting and solving errors is a part of programming, and every tool that'll expedite
the process should be considered as worth attantion.
